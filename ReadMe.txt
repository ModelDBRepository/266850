Example 1: Stimulation of a single terminal nerve-ending with a capsaicin-like current (Example1_single.hoc)
Example 2: Stimulation of all terminal nerve-endings with a capsaicin-like current (Example2_all.hoc)

*The user can also specify which terminals to stimulate with capsaicin by adjusting "NavLessStim_vec" vector in the Capsaicin_stimulation.hoc 
and uncommenting the last line of "Terminal Proj Main.hoc" file and running it.
